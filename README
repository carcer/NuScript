NuScript

NuScript is a .Net library providing an NUnit addin that can create test suites from DLR scripts in a specified directory.
Initially, only Python (i.e. IronPython) scripts are supported, but the base classes in the library allow for easy extension.

To use NuScript, create a class library and reference NuScript and NUnit.core.interfaces.
Create a public class in your library which inherits from ScriptSuiteBuilder. Mark this class with the NUnitAddIn attribute.
Create another public class which inherits from PythonSuiteDefinition. Override the implementation of the ScriptPath propert to return the path to the location of your Python scripts.
